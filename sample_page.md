## Exploratory Analysis of the Ethereum value 

**Project description:** Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurreny after the Bitcoin. It has gain a lot of attention last year. But while some see it as another potential investment, others predict it to be a more sophisticated version of its predecessor. The reason why leads in the general use of this technolgoies: Bitcoin is used a currency and Ethereum as "a ledger technology that companies are using to build new programs" (source: https://hackernoon.com/the-primary-difference-between-ethereum-and-bitcoin-a-beginners-guide-8a892afb7a4). In addition of feeding the aspirations ot a bunch of geeks, Ethereum drew the attention of a group called 'The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance', which is super-group of "Fortune 500 companies that have all agreed to work together to learn and build upon Ethereum’s blockchain technology — otherwise referred to as “smart contract” technology".

This time, we will solely look at Ethereum as a cryptocurrency and its market value. Our main assumption is: *The Ethereum value can be predicted with historical values, other cryptocurrencies'indexes or other markets* 

***Approach*** 

This project will focus on time-series analysis. 

***Data***
Ethereum Data come from http://coinmarketcap.com, which is a key resource for the crypto values
After choosing at least three different approaches for predicting the Ethereum price, I will analyze those and compare their accuracy


***Previous analysis made (and sources)***

1. MIT computer Scientists have predicted the fluctuations of the Bitcoin and have bet every two seconds accordindly to the predictions. (http://news.mit.edu/2014/mit-computer-scientists-can-predict-price-bitcoin) “We needed publicly available data, in large quantities and at an extremely fine scale,” says Shah, the Jamieson Career Development Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “We were also intrigued by the challenge of predicting a currency that has seen its prices see-saw regularly in the last few years.” They used historical data for it.
2. Predicting the fluctuations with Twitter Sentiment Analysis

3. Predicting Bitcoin index with Forum's comments

4. Using TensorFlow

***Risks***
I will need to be careful and transparent with the assumptions
As I have daily new data for the Ethereum, I will need to fix a timeframe from the beginning for each prediction. If possible (if weekly or daily prediction for example), I can take that opportunity to iterate the model and improve it



### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
