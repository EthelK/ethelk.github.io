## Network theories applied to Twitter 

Note: extracts from my paper "Brands on Twitter: Impact of the type of information on the typology of the network generated"

**Introduction** 

This research paper aims to study information diffusion through both network and content perspectives applied to 
the case of brands on Twitter. Existing literature about this subject usually drives a line between those areas while this 
paper presents the relationship between the profile of the first degree-nodes, called the “retweeters”, and the type of 
information to be spread. Results show that users considered as being highly influential individuals on the network will tend to spread information about new products and social causes, playing a central role in filtering and helping their own large audience discover new trends. 
Users considered as “low influencers” – with less than 200 followers- will seek for another specific type of 
tweets to spread that includes more practical information in order to satisfy an audience composed of fewer but closer followers.While results of the study must be taken carefully, the main added value of this paper is to offer another perspective of network study that allows for new social platforms such as Twitter.Possible applications of the approach as well as new areas for further investigation are numerous and include viral marketing, political campaigns and other phenomena where the number of nodes affected in a network in the context of information spread becomes an issue.

**Literature review** 

*Diffusion of information theories applied to Twitter*

From its beginning, the phenomenon of retweets has been examined in numerous studies,
especially in the computer sciences field where authors generally have the objective of building
a “retweet model” [24,20,23]. As a piece of information or idea spreading from nodes to nodes
into a large network, retweets are defined as a form of internet memes, which is a piece of
information or idea spreading among individuals within a network or culture. The author who
first introduced the subject, Richard Dawkins in “The Selfish Gene” defined it as a “unit of
cultural transmission”. [31]

Boyd et al. (2010) interpret the retweet action as a way to invite other users to take part in a
conversation and engage them without directly contacting these users. The authors determine
several reasons for retweeting: to amplify the message to a new audience, to amuse their
audience, to comment on a tweet, to publicly agree with the author of the original message and
to show the loyalty to him/her/the brand. [2]

In a social media where popularity and attention are of great value to the users, retweets are the
main metrics to evaluate the impact of the original message and how well that post was received
by the public. Being retweeted is not just a matter of popularity for individuals, but also a
medium for brands in order to spread their messages. In the retweets phenomenon, there is thus
a rebirth of the Word-Of-Mouth (WOM) model in a new area, the social media.

The general approach to information diffusion in social network is to split the network into
clusters that share similar characteristics. This type of typology usually serves well-defined
networks. However it is not the case when we approach online social networks such as Twitter,
where the amount and the diversity of the users make clear identification impossible. Yang and
Count (2009) found that the microblogging platform, because of its decentralized and locally
connected network, does not allow some of the most common social network metrics.

Additionally, this disconnectedness limits large scale information spread and, more specifically,
limits eWOM. [29]

Macskassy and Michelson (2011) show that users are more likely to retweet a message posted
by an author sharing the same type of interest. However, the studies show that users’ behaviors
follow a high variance when retweeting specific topics, highlighting the fact that followers use
various reasons when deciding to retweet or not. [18]

*Intrinsic features of retweeted posts*

Studies approaching the intrinsic characteristics of retweets are generally seen as tools for users
to increase the number of retweets per post. Dan Zarella explains: “Retweets may seem like a
small idea...but many of the lessons they teach us will be applicable to viral ideas in other
mediums." The key mechanisms for increasing the spread on the social network according to
the social and viral marketing scientist, are the links imbedded to the tweet, the interpellation of
the followers and the day of the week. Indeed, according to Zarella, 56,7 percent of the tweets
that have a URL are retweeted comparing to normal tweets that are 19 percent retweeted; asking
for retweeting leads to a higher spread and Friday is the day of the week with the higher rate of
retweets. However, there is no correlation between the number of followers and the depth of
stream, meaning the number of degrees the original message will pass through retweeting. [42,
57]

Suh et al. (2010) finds strong correlations between URL- or hashtag-tweet and retweetability.
The authors also finds a relationship between the number of previous tweets and the
retweetability of the user. The age of the account also has an impact on it. [24]

Chen et al. (2010), with this amount of information, take issue with scarcity of attention. Two
needs arise from this: filtering (from the various information received) to get the information
that is indeed of interest and discovery, where the users also want to discover new information
outside their field of interest.[3] Chen (2011) uses a “uses and gratifications approach”, relying
on the facts that numerous media compete for attention and that their audience will highly
depend on how well the media answers the needs in terms of social status, emotional link and
the need for information. [4] This theory has resurfaced in the past years with the rise of social
media because of the multiple niches of information that it offers. 


Using the uses and gratification approach, Johnson and Yang (2009) highlight the importance of
social and information motives for Twitter users. The authors claim that the main features that
users are looking for on the platform are helping them to connect with each other and
facilitating the communication between them. Eventually, results show that despite the strong
social aspect of the platform, the primary use of Twitter is information seeking and information
sharing. [29]

Starting from Sarwar et al.’s method, where neighborhoods were built based on similar
preferences, Chen et al. (2010) built clusters of followers and followees. This assumption was
based on the fact that people follow users that they consider worthy in terms of information
sources and topics of interest. [3] Weng et al. (2010) refer to this phenomenon as homophily,
where people from the same social network are homogenous regarding “sociodemographic,
behavioral and interpersonal characteristics”. [28] Applied to Twitter, it is assumed that users
will follow other users with whom they share topics of interest.

Boyd and Al. (2010) pointed out that retweets are sometimes driven by the audience of the
retweeters. Retweets are also used in the context of “social actions”, where the message
originally posted explicitly asks for retweet in order to sensitize to a particular subject and
engage the audience in the social wave so that it becomes a “trending topic”. However, the
authors highlighted that the success of this kind of spread is positively correlated with the
largeness of the network of the retweeters and serves as a gap between communities. In this
context, “Twitter-celebrities” who are followed by a large range of social groups have a central
role in the spread of the information. [2]

Another type of retweet, the “ego retweet”, is also noticed among brands on Twitter. In this
case, consumers who address a positive message to the company or mention it in a positive way
may be retweeted by the brand. The objective of this method is generally to get closer to the
consumers. [2]

*Extrinsic features of retweeted posts*

The environment in which the information will spread on Twitter can be divided into two
spaces, one fitting in the other. The first one is the network itself, connecting 255 million active
users [35] and described by Java et al. (2007) as being a “scale-free network”[14], where the
degree of distribution follows a power law. In that network, users are the vertices and edges are
the social interaction between them. [1] Another feature pointed out by Java et al. (2007) is the
“small-world” model, where a large network produces “small-world” properties meaning short
average path lengths and high clustering. [14, 26]

The second network is inserted in the first one and is specific to every tweet. Each message
published will “contaminate” a range of nodes or users depending on the network of the author
of that message and the degree of retweeting. According to the Pew Research Center, six types
of networks are observed though Twitter conversation. Of these typologies, three can be linked
to companies’ networks. At first, fragmented networks, where a network is formed around a
certain product. These clusters gather large heterogeneous populations with little connectivity
between them. Secondly, “In-Hub and Spoke” networks, with a star-like shape, where loyal
customers/followers will easily retweet the brand. The third type of conversation that brands on
Twitter typically show is the “Out-Hub and Spoke” network, where the brand answers to
customers/followers in order to support them or answer their requests. In both cases, the
connections between the followers are weak as well. 

The action of retweeting occurs in a frictionless and stable environment. Firstly, because of the
short period between the original message and the retweet, the topology of the network will
remain constant during contagion. Secondly, the technology of retweeting can be defined as
frictionless due to the costless production of it. [6]Twitter can be defined as an ideal space for
information to be spread because of the absence of friction and instability. Despite the
convenient environment for contagion, results show that retweets occur in the same range as
other social phenomena: 87 percent of retweeted tweets happen at one degree of distance. One
explanation given by the authors is the social distance between the users. [6]

Kwak and cha (2010) study the audience of a tweet by adding to the original author’s followers
the number of additional audiences that are not directly following the original poster. The authors showed that many retweeted tweets do have a significant amount of additional receivers. Above 1,000 “seed followers” –which is the case for all companies studied in thispaper-, the average number of this additional audience is not impacted by the number of
followers of the original author. [17]

*Brands on Twitter*

Because of the large audience they can find on the social networks, companies consider Twitter
as a place where they can spread information about their products and more generally brand
awareness. As for Twitter in general, understanding brands presence on the microblogging
platform requires network-related theory and content-related theory.

*Marketing and networks*

The internet has driven marketing strategies by applying Word-of-Mouth (WOM) concepts to
emails, blogs and other social networks as Twitter, giving rise to eWOM.
Jansen et al. (2009) found out that approximately 19 percent of the tweets published on the
microblogging platform were mentioning a brand in some way. This important proportion
proves that Twitter can be a “viable area for organizations for viral marketing campaigns”. [13]
At the base of WOM, defined by Katz and Lazarsfeld (1957) as an “act of exchanging
marketing information among consumers that plays an essential role in changing consumers’
attitudes and behaviors towards products and services” is the concept of influence [16] or “the
capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behaviour of someone or
something, or the effect itself.” [32]

Addressing Katz and Lazarsfeld model, the “two-step flow” model, where a small minority of
opinion leaders influencing larger circles of the society for spreading ideas and innovations,
Watts and Dodds (2007) found that influential individuals, in the context of expansion of
information context, are less important than the theoretical studies show. Rather than a few
highly influential nodes, the authors highlight a critical mass of easy-to-influence people. [27]

Twitter users who are considered as influential individuals on the network are usually experts in
their domain and offer relevant information to their followers about a specific topic or pass the
message between the source of the information and their audience. They can be political figures,
celebrities, journalists, or other influencers who already have an audience in “the real world” or
influencers who have their main public on the internet (blogs, Twitter, Google+,…). According
to the 2013 Digital Influence Report, around 86 percent of the social network’s influencers have
a blog, highlighting the fact that web presence is a strong characteristic of these influential
individuals. These special users are tracked by the companies since 38 percent of them are
following brands on Twitter. [33]

This strong power on the social networks leads to many propositions of branding from the
companies who want to reach the large audience of these influencers, especially because of the
specificity of this audience. Indeed, as explained earlier, Twitter influencers will usually publish
posts about a specific topic, gathering an audience responsive to this type of subjects. By
targeting influencers who share interests with the brand’s products or philosophy, the brand
aims to reach that audience. [33]

However this new version of celebrity endorsement can be criticized as it usually drives shortterm and/or ineffective behaviors. In this logic, another profile of followers is emphasized by
social media marketers: Brand advocates. These consumers, wanting to diffuse their satisfaction
about the brand around them, offer a reduced audience to companies but assure 92 percent of
trust among their public, to be compared with the 18 percent for influencers. This confirms the
study stating that over 40 percent of Americans seek for friends and family advice for
purchases. In the same logic, Domingos affirms that word-of-mouth marketing offers a
credibility –though the opinion of a friend or at least a trusted person- that ads do not. [5]
Popescu and Jain (2011) on business tweets, building a taxonomy of these messages in order to
categorize them. Five general classes appear. Firstly, generic content, with news and updates -
often including a URL- about the product (including opinions and advice) was the class of
tweets generating the most messages among brands. The second class is “engagement with
particular users”. It gathers conversations with customers, about brand feedback or technical
support. Another category is dedicated to “engagement with all the users”, where posts entice followers to participate in a contest. A fourth category is the announcement of events, deals, job
offering and other useful information. The last category is “brand awareness”. [21]


**Limitations** 
The dataset used for the paper shows several limitations. First, the number of observations is
lower than expected due to the addition of influencers’ variables. Researches allowed for the
number of followers of the retweeters on the applications are limited in time. In addition to this,
the restraint number of companies represents another quantitative limitation. 

Both of the above limitations were mainly raised by the fact that data were manually collected.
Most other studies about Twitter use computer sciences to collect the dataset which allows the
gathering of an impressive collection of tweets. However, the type of variables used in this
paper requires a “human eye” in order to understand the content of the tweet. Indeed, loads of
tweets referring to new products or events can only be detected with the help of brand and
product knowledge. Also, understanding “funny” references as well as celebrities’ endorsement
or the defense of a social cause cannot, with the resources available to me, be done
automatically.

Secondary, binary variables were completed based on my perception of the tweet. There may be
slight variations with other customers. Tweets that showed ambiguous characteristics were
categorized into the most relevant variable regarding key words, attachments and the main
message that is reflected in the post.

A third element to be pointed out is the difference of activity between the companies. Because
some of them have a narrowed number of tweets collected in comparison with other ones, this
could lead to a biased representation of the brands’ characteristics.
In addition of these limitations, the regressions of this paper suffer from a decrease in the
number of observations. The missing values can be a consequences of the numerous variables
used in the model.


**Assumptions**
The first assumption is that the number of retweets per tweet will not change in time, meaning
that figures will not change depending on the moment the tweet was collected. This assumption
is supported by the fact that 92,4 percent of the retweets happen within an hour after the original
tweet was posted [46]and that the collection of data was made the day after the original post.

The second assumption underlying the dataset is the fact that, while tweets were collected each
day between the 9th and 26th of July, time is not a source of variation for our dependent
variables. 

A third assumption is the fact that contributors and retweeters are similar individuals. While the
difference between both is usually small or insignificant, a clear statement is needed since both
metrics are counted with different means. On one side, the number of retweets is directly
computed on the original tweets. On the other side, the number of contributors is given by the
applications. Differences that may rise come from a user retweeting several times the same
tweet for example.

**Research question**

Probably one of thestrongest assumptions of the issue underlying this paper, this statement is however meaningful
regarding Fabrega (2012) results: 87 percent of tweets are retweeted at one degree of distance.
Only 7 percent of messages will be retweeted at two degrees of distance and 1 percent will
reach a third degree. [6]

The main research question, which aims to highlight causality between content-related features
and network-related ones, can be redefined: Is there a mechanism where the first generation of
retweeters around a company can be impacted by the type of information?

***Hypothesis 1: “New product” and “sponsor” have a positive effect on high influencers
retweets.***

Influential individuals have specific roles in information diffusion on network. Indeed, because
of the large amount of information available on the network, Chen et al. (2010) show that
individuals need to filter the contents and, at the same time, need to discover new ones that they
find relevant. [3]

***Hypothesis 2: Low influencers’ retweeted information shows specific features.***

Low influential individuals cannot be set aside. They represent the majority of the Twitter users:
81 percent of users have less than 50 followers and 91 percent of mentions come from users
with less than 500 followers [44]. This reduced audience, closer to the users, will usually be
composed of friends, family and known people. Because these followers also have an audience
to satisfy, we can suppose the objective they find in retweeting the brands still represent
relevant information. However, because the relationship with the audience is different, we can
assume that the type of information will be different than the first type of followers. In addition
to this, this type of user still represents the majority of brands’ followers and can be seen as
brand advocates. For the past years, with the rise of social media, this profile of customers drew
interest among marketers because of the lower costs generated by their engagement, the trust
they raise among other potential customers and the potential amount of them. [5] According to
Walker (1995), who states that 40 percent of Americans seek the advice of relatives and friends before purchasing [25], we can assume that the individual impact of this type of retweeter will
be considered as less important regarding the number of their own followers that will see the
retweeted message on their newsfeed. However, because they are superior in number and can
draw deeper influence among their connections, it is relevant to understand if a specific type of
tweet will also impact on their reaction. 

***Hypothesis 3: Known features influencing the number of retweets are different from the
characteristics that drive the type of retweeters.***

Another hypothesis for our results is that characteristics driving the number of retweets are
different from the ones having an impact on the type of followers. Observing the impact of an
attachments presence in a tweet, a feature about which most of the concerned studies agree to be
positive on the number of retweets, will be a way to compare this work with results from other
papers and highlight differences between these two types of approach to the retweet network.
[24, 57]

Both high and low influential individuals have specific profiles and goals when transferring
information to their own audience. Building two models with the proportion of high influencers
and low influencers as dependent variables in an OLS regression allows me to understand
which information will have an influence or not on the typology of the message network.
Besides the explicative variables that are the characteristics of the tweet in terms of productrelated and non-product-related content, control variables for companies are included in the
model in order to control for the specific characteristics of the brand. Indeed, we can reasonably
assume that the number of followers, the characteristics in terms of retweets, their sensitivities
and interests highly impact on the number of retweets. By controlling their effects through
binary variables, I create a fixed-effect in the OLS regression. To avoid the “dummy trap”, I
remove the “Lululemon” binary variable from the set. 

Both models have a similar structure: 

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-08-06 at 9.51.22 pm.png?raw=true"/> 

Where
Ya is log(high influencer/total of retweeters)
Yb is log(low influencers/total of retweeters)
They both are the dependent variable of model.

α is the constant.
Χ1 represent the variables of interest (“new product”; “contest and promotion”, “tips’,…).
Coefficients of these variables have a causal interpretation.
X2 represent the control variables (“Warby Parker”; “Starbucks”; “Taco Bell”;…). By adding
companies characteristics as control variables, the objective is making variables of interest
uncorrelated with the error term of the regression. However, these control variables do not have
a causal interpretation due to the fact that they are subject to omitted variables bias.
ui is the error term.  


**Results** 

*High influencers*

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-08-06 at 5.54.12 pm.png?raw=true"/>

The table above (Table 1) shows the first type of model of the research paper. Since the
dependent variable, the proportion of high influential retweeters on the total of retweeters, is a
proportion, I use a log-linear model. The first four models present results for the OLS regression
without the companies’ variables for control.

The first model uses three independent variables: “new product”, “sponsor” and “mention”. The
three coefficients are statistically significant, “sponsor” and “mention” being significant at 1
percent. More precisely, a tweet about a new product will lead to an increase of 17.3 percent of
“high influencers” in the first circle of first retweeters. The defense of a cause –“sponsor”- and
the mention of a user have a higher positive impact on this proportion with respectively an
increase of 39.8 percent and 50.7 percent.

The R-squared of these fourth models, ranging from 0.147 to 0.206, goes up to the range of
0.388 to 0.432 when adding the control variables for companies. The addition of control
variables has a noticeable impact on the effects of “new product” and “sponsor” on the
dependent variable: They become less significant if not insignificant. 

*Low influencers* 

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-08-06 at 5.54.26 pm.png?raw=true"/>

The second model shows the second type of model the research paper is
interested in. The general model is also a log-linear one. The first five models do not take into
account the fixed effects of companies.

The first model has “contest and promotion”, “tips” and “existing product” as independent
variables. While “existing product” coefficient does not show any significance, “tips” is
statistically significant at 1 percent and increases positively the proportion of low influencers at
30.1 percent. The “contest and promotion” coefficient is statistically significant at 10 percent
and increases the dependent variable at 10.9 percent. 

By controlling for companies, the R-squared more than doubles and increases from 0.109 to
0.251. The additional companies control variables raises the significance of “promotion and
contest” but makes the coefficient for “tips” insignificant as well as “sponsor”.
Both models were checked for homoscedasticity of residuals and multicollinearity. By using the
White’s test, testing that the variance of the residuals is homogenous, we could reject the null
hypothesis and assume that the variance is not homogenous. The variance inflation factor, or
VIF, checks for multicollinearity. Generally, VIF values higher than 10 induce further
investigation. However, VIFs are all lower than 3, which leads to the assumption that there is no
multicollinearity issues in the models.

**Results

Results of this paper are mixed. On one hand, they show statistical significance of several
variables on the dependent variables and confirmed a probable impact of content-related
features on typology-related ones. On the other hand, because of the limitation of the dataset
and the important impact of the companies’ characteristics, caution is required in the
interpretation of these results.

Results about low influencers have shown that these types of retweeters will spread a specific
type of information, confirming the second hypothesis. The main features of the information
were the presence of a contest or a promotion, advice and tips that have a positive impact on
their retweets. In addition to this, we observe that messages referring to the defense of a cause
from the companies or to emotionally-related content are considered as presenting less relevant
information to be spread. As for the high influencers, results show a positive impact when
mentioning a user and when referring to new products and the defense of a cause, but only when
companies’ characteristics are not controlled. The first hypothesis is thus partially confirmed.
The main assumption at the basis of the two first hypotheses is that the nature of the
relationships with the followers influences the type of information they seek and thus the type
of information the user will spread. This is consistent with Boyd and Al. (2010) who have
already raised evidence that the retweets will sometimes be driven by the audience of the
retweeter. [2] 

While closer links with the audience lead to the spread of product-related content
and “practical information” like promotions and tips, the role given to high influencers such as a
source of information filtering leads to less practical-content such as the defense of a cause and
innovative information like new products. This result is consistent with Chen et al. (2010)
conclusions that highlight the need for filtering and discovering new information in the context
of multiple information and scarcity of information in a large network. [3]

Other results arising from the regressions are more specific to Twitter itself. Mention and
conversation are a local mean for users to attract the attention of “high influencers” and thus
leads to a positive impact of their proportion in the retweeters’ population.

Regarding the large influence of the control variables, two points have to be stressed. Firstly,
the above implications have to be taken carefully. Further investigation should compose a dataset made of a larger collection of companies from various industries. Secondly, while we
cannot properly interpret control variables, their important effect on the R-squared and on the
significances of other variables imply that companies’ characteristics do weight in the
typologies of these networks. One hypothesis is that specific profiles follow a certain type of
company. This issue could also be an additional research field in further studies.

The third hypothesis made in this paper was the fact that retweets-drivers are different from
type-of-retweeters-drivers. The hypothesis is confirmed but only in the specific case of
attachment presence, which is the only retweets-drivers about which all studies agree.
This research paper aims to approach how different first degree nodes characterized by the
number of their connections, in a network that is Twitter, will select a certain type of
information in business tweets to be spread to their own audience. 

The objective of this research is to present another type of approach of networks issues, taking into account both network
characteristics and content characteristics. In fact, most known papers study one side or another
but rarely both at the same time. The field of the research, brands on Twitter, allows us to
collect the data needed, even if they are still limited because of Twitter’s time restrictions. In
addition to this, the nature of the field became an intensively studied area for social media
marketers who perceive in Twitter a new way to apply Word-of-Mouth. Both presented profiles
have already been presented in previous studies: A highly influential individual with a large
audience that can reach numerous other individuals and a low influential individual, also called
a brand advocate, is strongly committed to the brand and deeply impact on a small audience.
While the first profile has already been largely studied, the other ones, by its majority on social
networks as Twitter and the deeper influence it causes, deserve more investigation. Social
platforms as Twitter allows researchers to collect a large dataset of the features influencing this
profile and consists in a relevant studied area for marketing and, more generally, influence.
However, the main issue to be found in the research area is the willingness to see the original
information spreads. Thus, the issue could have been applied to other subjects as political
campaigns or star endorsement. By approaching retweets not as being homogenous but as
heterogeneous pieces of information in the context of a network and presenting features that specific profiles are seeking in order to satisfy their particular audience, results arising from this
paper can be tested in these other areas.
