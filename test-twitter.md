Introduction

This research paper aims to study information diffusion through both network and content perspectives applied to the case of brands on Twitter. Existing literature about this subject usually drives a line between those areas while this paper presents the relationship between the profile of the first degree-nodes, called the “retweeters”, and the type of information to be spread. Results show that users considered as being highly influential individuals on the network will tend to spread information about new products and social causes, playing a central role in filtering and helping their own large audience discover new trends. Users considered as “low influencers” – with less than 200 followers- will seek for another specific type of tweets to spread that includes more practical information in order to satisfy an audience composed of fewer but closer followers. While results of the study must be taken carefully, the main added value of this paper is to offer another perspective of network study that allows for new social platforms such as Twitter.Possible applications of the approach as well as new areas for further investigation are numerous and include viral marketing, political campaigns and other phenomena where the number of nodes affected in a network in the context of information spread becomes an issue.
